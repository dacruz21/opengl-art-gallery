# Art Gallery

## By David Cruz

(GitHub users: this repository is a clone of [the original GitLab repository](https://gitlab.com/TypoKign/art-gallery))

This is an archive of my Spring semester final for AP Computer Science. It is a 
simple rendering and sound engine that I created following a series by YouTube 
channel [thebennybox](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCnlpv-hhcsAtEHKR2y2fW4Q). 
I've made some modifications of my own along the way.

There is a small presentation of the project in the html directory.

The engine supports:
 - Textured meshes in a three-dimensional environment
 - Phong lighting with point lights, spot lights, and directional lights
 - Directional sound

The end result is a simple room, illuminated with a single light, filled with some artwork and a 3D model.

### Building this project

I honestly have no idea anymore, just enjoy the source code. You'll have to link LWJGL and the binaries for your system, but I can't remember much past that.
